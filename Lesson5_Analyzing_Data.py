# Using group

#!/usr/bin/env python
"""
The tweets in our twitter collection have a field called "source". This field describes the application
that was used to create the tweet. Following the examples for using the $group operator, your task is 
to modify the 'make-pipeline' function to identify most used applications for creating tweets. 
As a check on your query, 'web' is listed as the most frequently used application.
'Ubertwitter' is the second most used. 

Please modify only the 'make_pipeline' function so that it creates and returns an aggregation pipeline
that can be passed to the MongoDB aggregate function. As in our examples in this lesson, the aggregation 
pipeline should be a list of one or more dictionary objects. 
Please review the lesson examples if you are unsure of the syntax.

Your code will be run against a MongoDB instance that we have provided. 
If you want to run this code locally on your machine, you have to install MongoDB, 
download and insert the dataset.
For instructions related to MongoDB setup and datasets please see Course Materials.

Please note that the dataset you are using here is a smaller version of the twitter dataset 
used in examples in this lesson. 
If you attempt some of the same queries that we looked at in the lesson examples,
your results will be different.

Write an aggregation query to answer this question:

Of the users in the "Brasilia" timezone who have tweeted 100 times or more,
who has the largest number of followers?

The following hints will help you solve this problem:
- Time zone is found in the "time_zone" field of the user object in each tweet.
- The number of tweets for each user is found in the "statuses_count" field.
  To access these fields you will need to use dot notation (from Lesson 4)
- Your aggregation query should return something like the following:
{u'ok': 1.0,
 u'result': [{u'_id': ObjectId('52fd2490bac3fa1975477702'),
                  u'followers': 2597,
                  u'screen_name': u'marbles',
                  u'tweets': 12334}]}
Note that you will need to create the fields 'followers', 'screen_name' and 'tweets'.

For this exercise, let's return to our cities infobox dataset. The question we would like you to answer
is as follows:  Which region or district in India contains the most cities?

As a starting point, use the solution for the example question we looked at -- "Who includes the most
user mentions in their tweets?"

One thing to note about the cities data is that the "isPartOf" field contains an array of regions or 
districts in which a given city is found. See the example document in Instructor Comments below.

# 	Using push

#!/usr/bin/env python
"""
$push is similar to $addToSet. The difference is that rather than accumulating only unique values 
it aggregates all values into an array.

Using an aggregation query, count the number of tweets for each user. In the same $group stage, 
use $push to accumulate all the tweet texts for each user. Limit your output to the 5 users
with the most tweets. 
Your result documents should include only the fields:
"_id" (screen name of user), 
"count" (number of tweets found for the user),
"tweet_texts" (a list of the tweet texts found for the user).  

Please modify only the 'make_pipeline' function so that it creates and returns an aggregation 
pipeline that can be passed to the MongoDB aggregate function. As in our examples in this lesson,

In an earlier exercise we looked at the cities dataset and asked which region in India contains 
the most cities. In this exercise, we'd like you to answer a related question regarding regions in 
India. What is the average city population for a region in India? Calculate your answer by first 
finding the average population of cities in each region and then by calculating the average of the 
regional averages.

Hint: If you want to accumulate using values from all input documents to a group stage, you may use 
a constant as the value of the "_id" field. For example, 
    { "$group" : {"_id" : "India Regional City Population Average",
      ... }
